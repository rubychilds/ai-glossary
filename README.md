# Ruby: AI Glossary


When I first encountered artificial intelligence, I was overwhelmed by the *jargon* and *technical complexity* that seemed to create barriers rather than bridges to understanding. Terms like "backpropagation," "neural networks," and "machine learning" were thrown around in conversations and articles without clear explanations, leaving me feeling excluded from discussions about technology that was rapidly reshaping our world. I realized that many others shared this frustration – from business leaders trying to understand AI's potential for their organizations, to students beginning their journey into computer science, to curious individuals who simply wanted to grasp how these systems that increasingly influence our daily lives actually work.

This experience sparked my motivation to create a **comprehensive AI terminology guide** that demystifies the field without dumbing it down. I believe that understanding AI shouldn't require a PhD in computer science, but it also shouldn't sacrifice accuracy for accessibility. My goal is to bridge that gap – to provide clear, precise definitions and explanations that respect both the complexity of the subject and the intelligence of readers who are new to it. This guide represents my attempt to create the resource I wish I had when I first started exploring AI, one that explains not just what these terms mean, but why they matter and how they connect to the broader landscape of artificial intelligence that shapes our world.


## Local Development

First, run `pnpm i` to install the dependencies

Then, run `pnpm dev` to start the development server and visit localhost:3000.
