# Loss Function

A function that measures how wrong a model's predictions are compared to the true values.

The loss function quantifies the difference between predicted and actual outcomes, providing a signal for the learning algorithm to improve. Different tasks require different loss functions, and the choice significantly impacts model behavior.

Examples: Mean Squared Error for regression, Cross-Entropy Loss for classification, Huber Loss for robust regression.

Challenges: Choosing appropriate loss functions for the task, handling class imbalances, ensuring the loss function aligns with business objectives, and dealing with outliers.
