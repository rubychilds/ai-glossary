Language Model
Short Definition: An AI model that learns to predict and generate human language text.
Longer Definition: Language models learn statistical patterns in text to understand and generate human language. They can predict the next word in a sequence, complete sentences, answer questions, and perform various language tasks by learning from large text corpora.
Examples: GPT series, BERT, T5, PaLM, language models in translation systems and chatbots.
Challenges: Understanding context and nuance, maintaining consistency over long texts, avoiding biased or harmful outputs, computational requirements, and ensuring factual accuracy.
History: Evolved from statistical n-gram models to neural approaches. Transformer architecture (2017) revolutionized the field, leading to increasingly large and capable models.
