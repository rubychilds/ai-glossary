Supervised Learning

Short Definition: A machine learning approach that learns from input-output pairs to make predictions on new data.
Longer Definition: Supervised learning uses labeled training data where both inputs and correct outputs are provided. The algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs, then applies this learned mapping to make predictions on new, unlabeled data.
Examples: Email spam detection, image classification, medical diagnosis, price prediction, language translation.
Challenges: Requires labeled data which can be expensive to obtain, may not generalize well if training data is not representative, and performance is limited by label quality.
