# Hallucination

When AI models generate false or nonsensical information that appears plausible.

Longer Definition: Hallucinations occur when AI systems, particularly language models, produce outputs that are factually incorrect, fabricated, or inconsistent with reality, despite appearing confident and coherent. This happens because models learn statistical patterns rather than true understanding.

Examples: Chatbots citing non-existent research papers, generating fake historical events, or providing incorrect medical advice with confidence.

Challenges: Difficult to detect automatically, can mislead users who trust AI outputs, particularly problematic in high-stakes applications like healthcare or legal advice, and challenging to eliminate without reducing model creativity.
