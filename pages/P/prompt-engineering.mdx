# Prompt Engineering

The practice of designing and optimizing prompts to get better results from AI models.

Longer Definition: Prompt engineering involves systematically crafting inputs to AI models to elicit desired behaviors, improve accuracy, and achieve specific outcomes. It includes techniques like few-shot learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and role-playing.

Examples: Using examples in prompts (few-shot), asking models to think step-by-step, providing role context ("You are an expert in...").

Challenges: Prompts can be brittle and model-specific, finding optimal prompts is often trial-and-error, and results may not transfer well between different models or versions.
