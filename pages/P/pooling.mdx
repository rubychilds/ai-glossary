# Pooling

Pooling Layers is a technique used in convolutional neural networks to reduce the spatial dimensions of feature maps by calculating the average value within a defined window (or region). It effectively downsamples the input while preserving the general characteristics of the data, acting as a smoothing operation

Pooling serves multiple purposes: reducing computational load, controlling overfitting, and creating hierarchical feature representations.

## Max Pooling 

Max pooling selects the maximum value from each region preserving the strongest feature responses while providing translation invariance and computational efficiency. 

## Average Pooling

Average pooling computes the mean, providing a smoother downsampling but potentially losing important peak responses.
