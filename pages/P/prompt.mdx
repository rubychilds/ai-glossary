Prompt

Short Definition: The input text or instruction given to an AI model to generate a desired response.
Longer Definition: A prompt is the human-readable instruction or query that guides an AI model's output. Effective prompts can include context, examples, specific instructions, and formatting requirements to achieve desired results.
Examples: "Summarize this article in 3 bullet points," "Write a Python function to sort a list," "Translate this to French: Hello, world!"
Challenges: Crafting clear and unambiguous instructions, avoiding prompt injection attacks, managing context length limitations, and ensuring consistent outputs across similar prompts.
