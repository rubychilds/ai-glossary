Embedding
Short Definition: A way of representing data (like words or images) as dense numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning.
Longer Definition: Embeddings map discrete objects into continuous vector spaces where similar items are located close together. They allow AI models to work with categorical data by converting it into numerical form while preserving important relationships and meanings.
Examples: Word2Vec for word embeddings, image embeddings for visual search, user embeddings for recommendations, protein embeddings for drug discovery.
Challenges: Capturing all relevant semantic relationships, handling out-of-vocabulary items, ensuring embeddings don't encode unwanted biases, and determining optimal dimensionality.
