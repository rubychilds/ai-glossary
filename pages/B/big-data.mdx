# Big Data

Short Definition: Extremely large datasets that require specialized tools and techniques to process and analyze.
Longer Definition: Big Data refers to datasets characterized by the "5 Vs": Volume (massive amounts), Velocity (high-speed generation), Variety (different formats), Veracity (quality and accuracy), and Value (meaningful insights). These datasets exceed the processing capabilities of traditional database systems.
Examples: Social media posts, IoT sensor data, financial transactions, web clickstreams, satellite imagery.
Challenges: Storage and processing costs, data quality issues, privacy concerns, difficulty in extracting meaningful insights, and the need for specialized infrastructure and skills.
