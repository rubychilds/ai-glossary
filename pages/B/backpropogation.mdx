# Backpropagation

Short Definition: An algorithm used to train neural networks by calculating and propagating errors backward through the network.

Longer Definition: Backpropagation calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight in the neural network. It works by computing the error at the output layer and then propagating this error backward through the network layers, adjusting weights to minimize future errors.

Examples: Used in training deep neural networks for image recognition, natural language processing, and most modern AI applications.

Challenges: Can suffer from vanishing or exploding gradients in very deep networks, may get stuck in local minima, and requires careful hyperparameter tuning.
History: Developed in the 1970s and popularized in the 1980s by Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams. It became the foundation for training most neural networks.
