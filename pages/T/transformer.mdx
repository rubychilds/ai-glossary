# Transformer

A neural network architecture that uses attention mechanisms to efficiently process sequential data.

A *transformer* is a neural network architecture that revolutionized machine learning, particularly in natural language processing. Introduced in the 2017 paper "Attention Is All You Need," transformers have become the foundation for most modern AI language models.

*Transformers* use self-attention to weigh the importance of different parts of the input when processing each element. This allows parallel processing and better handling of long-range dependencies compared to RNNs, making them highly effective for language tasks.

Impact and Applications *Transformers* power virtually all modern large language models including GPT, BERT, T5, and Claude. They've enabled breakthroughs in machine translation, text generation, question answering, and even expanded beyond text to images, audio, and other domains.

The transformer architecture represents one of the most significant advances in deep learning, enabling the current generation of powerful AI systems.

- **Core Innovation**: Self-Attention The transformer's key breakthrough is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence when processing each word. Unlike previous models that processed text sequentially, transformers can examine all words simultaneously and understand their relationships to each other.

- **How Self-Attention Works** When processing a sentence like "The cat sat on the mat because it was comfortable," the transformer can directly connect "it" to "mat" by calculating attention weights, determining which words are most relevant to understanding each word's meaning in context.

## Architecture Components

- **Encoder-Decoder Structure** - The original transformer has an encoder (processes input) and decoder (generates output). Many modern models use only the encoder (like BERT) or only the decoder (like GPT).

- **Multi-Head Attention** - Multiple attention mechanisms run in parallel, allowing the model to focus on different types of relationships simultaneously.

- **Position Encoding** - Since transformers process all words simultaneously, they need explicit information about word order.

- **Feed-Forward Networks** - Process the attention outputs through additional neural network layers.

## Key Advantages

- **Parallelization** - Unlike RNNs that process words one at a time, transformers can process entire sequences simultaneously, making training much faster.

- **Long-range dependencies** - Can capture relationships between distant words more effectively than previous architectures.

- **Scalability** - Architecture scales well with increased data and computational resources.
