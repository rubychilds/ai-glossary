Transformer

Short Definition: A neural network architecture that uses attention mechanisms to efficiently process sequential data.

Longer Definition: Transformers use self-attention to weigh the importance of different parts of the input when processing each element. This allows parallel processing and better handling of long-range dependencies compared to RNNs, making them highly effective for language tasks.

Examples: BERT, GPT models, T5, machine translation systems, image processing (Vision Transformers).

Challenges: Quadratic computational complexity with sequence length, requires large amounts of training data, memory intensive, and can be difficult to interpret attention patterns.

History: Introduced in "Attention is All You Need" (2017). Revolutionized NLP and became the foundation for most modern language models. Extended to computer vision and other domains.
