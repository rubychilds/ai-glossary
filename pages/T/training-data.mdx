Training Data

Short Definition: The dataset used to teach machine learning models patterns and relationships.
Longer Definition: Training data consists of examples that algorithms use to learn patterns, make associations, and build predictive models. The quality, quantity, and representativeness of training data fundamentally determines model performance and capabilities.
Examples: Images with labels for computer vision, text corpora for language models, historical sales data for forecasting, medical records for diagnosis systems.
Challenges: Data quality and consistency, ensuring sufficient quantity and diversity, handling bias and representativeness, privacy and ethical concerns, and managing costs of data collection and labeling.
