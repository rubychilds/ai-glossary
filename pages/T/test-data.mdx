# Test Data / Validation Data

Short Definition: Datasets used to evaluate model performance and tune hyperparameters, separate from training data.

Longer Definition: Test data provides an unbiased evaluation of final model performance, while validation data is used during development to tune hyperparameters and make model selection decisions. This separation prevents overfitting and gives realistic performance estimates.

Examples: Holding out 20% of data for testing, using cross-validation for model selection, creating separate validation sets for hyperparameter tuning.

Challenges: Ensuring data splits are representative, avoiding data leakage between sets, determining appropriate split ratios, and handling temporal or geographical dependencies.
