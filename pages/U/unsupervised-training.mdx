# Unsupervised Learning

Short Definition: Machine learning that finds patterns in data without labeled examples or target outputs.
Longer Definition: Unsupervised learning discovers hidden structures in data where no correct answers are provided. It identifies patterns, groups similar data points, or learns compressed representations without explicit supervision.
Examples: Customer segmentation through clustering, anomaly detection in network traffic, dimensionality reduction for data visualization, recommendation systems based on user behavior.
Challenges: Difficult to evaluate results without ground truth, determining optimal number of clusters or components, interpreting discovered patterns, and ensuring patterns are meaningful rather than artifacts.
