# Underfitting

When a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance.

Underfitting occurs when a model lacks sufficient complexity to learn the relationships in the training data. The model performs poorly on both training and test data because it cannot represent the true underlying function.
Examples: Using linear regression for highly non-linear data, neural networks with too few layers or neurons, decision trees that are too shallow.

Challenges: Recognizing underfitting vs other performance issues, determining appropriate model complexity, balancing between underfitting and overfitting, and ensuring sufficient training time.
