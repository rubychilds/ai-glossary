# Machine Learning (ML)

A method of data analysis that automates analytical model building using algorithms that learn from data.

Machine learning enables computers to learn and improve performance on tasks without being explicitly programmed for each specific case. It uses statistical techniques to identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns.

Examples: Recommendation systems, fraud detection, predictive maintenance, medical diagnosis, autonomous vehicles.

Challenges: Data quality and quantity requirements, model interpretability, overfitting, bias in algorithms and data, and ensuring robust performance in real-world conditions.
History: Term coined by Arthur Samuel in 1959. Field developed through statistical learning theory, neural networks, and expert systems, with major advances in the 2000s-2010s driven by big data and computational power.
