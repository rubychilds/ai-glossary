# MCP (Model Context Protocol)

A standardized way for AI models to connect with external data sources and tools.

Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a universal interface that allows language models to securely access and interact with various external systems, databases, and APIs. It enables models to retrieve real-time information and perform actions beyond their training data.

Before MCP, each AI application had to build custom integrations with different services, databases, and tools. AI models lacked an equivalent to APIs, which were the internet's first great unifier for software communication. MCP solves this by providing a standardized protocol.

MCP has gained significant traction within developer and AI communities Andreessen HorowitzPragmaticengineer since its launch. Just a few months after its release, MCP adoption is growing The interoperability breakthrough.
