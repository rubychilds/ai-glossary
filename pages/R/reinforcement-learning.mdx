Reinforcement Learning
Short Definition: A learning paradigm where agents learn through trial and error by receiving rewards or penalties for their actions.
Longer Definition: Reinforcement learning involves an agent interacting with an environment, taking actions, and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. The agent learns to maximize cumulative rewards over time through exploration and exploitation.
Examples: Game playing (AlphaGo, chess), robotic control, autonomous vehicles, recommendation systems, trading algorithms.
Challenges: Sparse rewards, exploration vs exploitation trade-off, sample efficiency, handling large state spaces, and ensuring safe exploration in real-world applications.
History: Rooted in behavioral psychology and optimal control theory. Modern RL developed in the 1980s-90s. Deep Q-Networks (2015) and AlphaGo (2016) marked major breakthroughs.
