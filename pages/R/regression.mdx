Regression

Short Definition: A supervised learning task that predicts continuous numerical values.
Longer Definition: Regression algorithms learn relationships between input features and continuous target variables, enabling prediction of numerical outcomes. Unlike classification which predicts categories, regression predicts quantities along a continuous scale.
Examples: Predicting house prices, stock values, temperature, sales forecasts, patient recovery times.
Challenges: Handling non-linear relationships, dealing with outliers, feature selection, ensuring assumptions are met (for linear regression), and avoiding overfitting.
