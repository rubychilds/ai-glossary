# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

A technique that combines information retrieval with text generation to provide more accurate and up-to-date responses.

RAG systems first retrieve relevant documents or information from a knowledge base, then use that context to generate responses. This allows models to access current information beyond their training data and cite sources for their answers.

Examples: Question-answering systems that search documents before responding, chatbots that access company knowledge bases, research assistants that cite academic papers.

Challenges: Ensuring retrieval quality and relevance, managing computational overhead, handling conflicting information sources, and maintaining response coherence.
