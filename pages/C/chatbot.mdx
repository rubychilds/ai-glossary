Chatbot
Short Definition: An AI program designed to simulate conversation with human users.
Longer Definition: Chatbots use natural language processing to understand user inputs and generate appropriate responses. They range from simple rule-based systems following predefined scripts to sophisticated AI models that can engage in complex, contextual conversations.
Examples: Customer service bots, virtual assistants (ChatGPT, Claude), website help systems, mental health support bots.
Challenges: Understanding context and nuance, maintaining conversation flow, handling ambiguous queries, avoiding inappropriate responses, and providing accurate information.
