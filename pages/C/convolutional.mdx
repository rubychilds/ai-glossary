Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Short Definition: A type of neural network especially effective for processing grid-like data such as images.
Longer Definition: CNNs use convolutional layers that apply filters to detect local features like edges and patterns. They typically include pooling layers for dimensionality reduction and are designed to be translation-invariant, meaning they can recognize features regardless of their position in the input.
Examples: Image classification (ImageNet), facial recognition, medical image analysis, autonomous vehicle vision systems.
Challenges: Requires large amounts of training data, computationally intensive, may not handle rotated or scaled images well without data augmentation, and can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks.
History: Inspired by the visual cortex, developed by Yann LeCun in the 1980s-90s. AlexNet (2012) marked the beginning of the deep learning revolution in computer vision.
