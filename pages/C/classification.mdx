Classification
Short Definition: A supervised learning task that predicts which category or class an input belongs to.
Longer Definition: Classification algorithms learn to assign discrete labels or categories to input data based on training examples. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the class of new, unseen data points.
Examples: Email spam detection, image recognition (cat vs. dog), medical diagnosis, sentiment analysis, credit approval.
Challenges: Handling imbalanced datasets, overfitting, feature selection, dealing with overlapping classes, and ensuring good generalization to new data.
