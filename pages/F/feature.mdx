# Feature

An individual measurable property or characteristic of an observed phenomenon.

Longer Definition: Features are the input variables that machine learning algorithms use to make predictions. They can be raw data (like pixel values) or engineered attributes (like age from birthdate). Good feature selection and engineering are crucial for model performance.

Examples: In house price prediction: square footage, location, number of bedrooms. In image classification: pixel intensities, edges, textures.

Challenges: Feature selection (choosing relevant features), feature engineering (creating useful features), handling missing values, scaling and normalization, and avoiding feature leakage.
