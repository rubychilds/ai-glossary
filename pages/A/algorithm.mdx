# Algorithm

A set of rules or instructions for solving a problem or completing a task.

In AI, an algorithm is a step-by-step computational procedure that takes input data and transforms it into desired output. Algorithms form the foundation of all AI systems, defining how machines process information, learn patterns, and make decisions.

## What an Algorithm Really Is

Think of an algorithm like a recipe, but for computers. Just as a recipe tells you step-by-step how to make a cake, an algorithm tells a computer step-by-step how to solve a problem.

Simple algorithms form the foundation of AI and machine learning, offering straightforward, interpretable solutions that are often surprisingly effective for many real-world problems. These algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, and k-nearest neighbors, use basic mathematical principles and logical rules that can be easily understood and explained—a decision tree might simply ask "Is income above $50,000?" followed by "Is credit score above 650?" to determine loan approval. While they may lack the sophistication of deep neural networks, simple algorithms have distinct advantages: they require minimal computational resources, train quickly on small datasets, are less prone to overfitting, and provide transparent decision-making processes that humans can audit and trust. In many practical applications, simple algorithms perform nearly as well as complex ones—a basic logistic regression model might achieve 85% accuracy on email spam detection compared to a neural network's 87%, but with vastly lower computational costs and much greater interpretability. These algorithms serve as essential baselines for comparing more complex methods, are ideal for applications requiring explainable AI (like medical diagnosis or legal decisions), and remain the go-to choice when data is limited, resources are constrained, or when the cost of errors is high and transparency is paramount.

Complex algorithms, particularly deep learning models and ensemble methods, represent the cutting edge of AI capability, using sophisticated mathematical structures with millions or billions of parameters to solve problems that simpler methods cannot handle. These algorithms, including deep neural networks, transformers, and advanced ensemble techniques, excel at finding intricate patterns in high-dimensional data—enabling breakthroughs like GPT-4's human-like text generation, computer vision systems that surpass human accuracy in medical imaging, and game-playing AI that masters complex strategy games. However, their complexity comes with significant trade-offs: they require enormous datasets (often millions of examples), massive computational resources for training and deployment, and operate as "black boxes" where even their creators cannot fully explain how they arrive at specific decisions. A single large language model might contain 175 billion parameters and cost millions of dollars to train, yet still produce unexpected or biased outputs that are difficult to predict or control. Despite these challenges, complex algorithms are essential for tackling humanity's most difficult problems—from drug discovery and climate modeling to autonomous vehicles and scientific research—where their ability to process vast amounts of information and detect subtle patterns far exceeds human capability, making them indispensable tools for advancing technology and knowledge.

### Simple Real-World Algorithm Example: Algorithm: "How to make coffee"
1. Fill kettle with water
2. Heat water to 200°F
3. Grind coffee beans
4. Put coffee in filter
5. Pour hot water over coffee
6. Wait 4 minutes
7. Serve

### Simple Computer Algorithm Example: Algorithm: "Find the largest number in a list"
1. Start with the first number
2. Compare it to the next number
3. If the next number is bigger, remember that one instead
4. Repeat until you've checked all numbers
5. Return the biggest one you found


## Algorithms in AI Context
In AI, algorithms are much more sophisticated, but the principle is the same - they're step-by-step instructions for solving problems.

### Types of AI Algorithms

1. Learning Algorithms (How AI learns from data)
* Linear Regression: Finds the best line through data points
* Neural Networks: Mimics brain neurons to recognize patterns
* Decision Trees: Creates a series of yes/no questions to classify things

2. Optimization Algorithms (How AI improves itself)
* Gradient Descent: Like rolling a ball down a hill to find the bottom (best solution)
* Genetic Algorithms: Evolves solutions like natural selection
* Adam Optimizer: Smart way to adjust AI model parameters

3. Search Algorithms (How AI explores possibilities)
* A Search:* Finds shortest path (used in GPS navigation)
* Monte Carlo Tree Search: Explores game moves (used in chess AI)

## The Importance of Algorithms
Algorithms can determine what is possible, for example. our phones work have facial recognition by using convolutional neural networks. 

## Challenges of Algorithms

### 1. Bias in Algorithms
The issue: Some algorithms learn from biased training data Human designers unconsciously build in biases Algorithm optimizes for wrong objectives. 

Algorithm bias occurs when AI systems produce systematically unfair or discriminatory results, often reflecting prejudices present in their training data or design process.The bias typically stems from historical inequalities embedded in training datasets, underrepresentation of certain groups in the data, or unconscious biases from the developers themselves. What makes algorithmic bias particularly dangerous is that it can appear objective and scientific while actually perpetuating or amplifying existing societal inequalities at massive scale. For instance, if a hiring algorithm is trained on past hiring decisions that favored men, it will learn to replicate this pattern, potentially screening out qualified female candidates automatically. Addressing algorithmic bias requires careful attention to data collection, diverse development teams, regular auditing of AI systems for discriminatory outcomes, and sometimes accepting trade-offs between accuracy and fairness to ensure equitable treatment across all groups.

Example:

Hiring algorithm trained on past hiring decisions Past hiring favored men over women

* Algorithm learns "male names = good candidates"
* Result: Algorithm discriminates against women
* Solution: Audit training data, test for fairness

### 2. Generalization Problems
The issue: Algorithm works great on training data but fails on new data

Generalization is an algorithm's ability to perform well on new, unseen data that differs from what it was trained on, representing one of the most critical challenges in AI development. A well-generalizing algorithm learns the underlying patterns and principles from training data rather than simply memorizing specific examples, allowing it to make accurate predictions when encountering novel situations. Poor generalization often manifests as overfitting, where an algorithm performs excellently on training data but fails dramatically in real-world applications—like a medical AI trained only on X-rays from one hospital struggling to diagnose patients from a different facility with different equipment. The challenge intensifies when algorithms encounter "distribution shift," where real-world conditions differ significantly from training conditions, such as an autonomous vehicle trained in sunny California failing to navigate snowy roads in Michigan. Achieving good generalization requires diverse, representative training data, appropriate model complexity, regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, and thorough testing across varied scenarios. Ultimately, an algorithm's value lies not in its training performance but in its ability to maintain accuracy and reliability when deployed in the unpredictable, messy real world where conditions constantly change and edge cases are common.

Example:

* Training: AI learns to recognize cats using photos from sunny California
* Deployment: AI fails to recognize cats in snowy Michigan
* Problem: Never learned that cats can be in snow
* Solution: More diverse training data

### 3. Computational Expense
The cost of algorithms varies dramatically based on their complexity and intended applications. Training expenses can range from virtually nothing for simple algorithms to millions of dollars for cutting-edge AI systems. For instance, training GPT-3 required approximately $4.6 million in compute costs, while large-scale image recognition models demand weeks of processing time across hundreds of GPUs. In contrast, a basic spam filter can be trained in minutes on a standard laptop. 

Runtime costs follow a similar pattern, where each ChatGPT response costs roughly $0.002 to generate, Google searches cost fractions of a penny, and simpler algorithms run for negligible amounts. This creates a fundamental trade-off in AI development: more sophisticated and capable algorithms typically require substantially higher computational resources both during training and deployment, forcing developers to balance performance gains against economic constraints when selecting algorithms for their applications.

Training costs:

* GPT-3 training: ~$4.6 million in compute costs
* Large image recognition: Weeks on hundreds of GPUs
Simple spam filter: Minutes on a laptop

Runtime costs:

ChatGPT response: ~$0.002 per response
Google search: Fractions of a penny
Trade-off: More powerful algorithms cost more to run

### 4. Black Box Problem
The black box problem represents one of the most significant challenges in modern AI, particularly with complex algorithms like deep neural networks. Many powerful AI systems operate as "black boxes," meaning their internal decision-making processes remain opaque and difficult to interpret, even to their creators. While a simple decision tree algorithm clearly shows which features led to a specific prediction, a neural network with millions of parameters processes information through layers of mathematical transformations that resist straightforward explanation. This lack of transparency becomes critical in high-stakes applications such as medical diagnosis, criminal justice, or financial lending, where understanding why an algorithm made a particular decision is as important as the decision itself.

 The problem intensifies as algorithms become more sophisticated; the most capable AI systems often sacrifice interpretability for performance. Researchers are actively developing explainable AI techniques, including attention mechanisms, feature importance scores, and model-agnostic explanation methods, but these solutions often provide only partial insights into the algorithm's reasoning. This ongoing tension between algorithmic power and interpretability continues to shape both AI development and regulatory discussions around algorithmic accountability.

It is important to ensure we can understand an algorithm, and it isn't a black-box to explain and interpret outcomes. For example. If an AI recommends a medical treament, a Doctor needs to know why the AI recommended that specific treatment. Additionally legally, we need to be able to explain why an outcome has been produced, to provide reasoning within court, and with financial decisions, we need to explain lending decisions. 

#### Interpretable algorithms:

* Decision tree: "Rejected loan because income < $50,000"
* Linear regression: "House price = $200/sqft × size + $50,000 base"
* You can explain exactly why they made decisions

#### Black box algorithms:

* Deep neural network: "Cat detected" but can't explain why
* Uses millions of calculations across hundreds of layers
* Even experts can't fully explain the decisions
