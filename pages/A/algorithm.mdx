# Algorithm

Short Definition: A set of rules or instructions for solving a problem or completing a task.

Longer Definition: In AI, an algorithm is a step-by-step computational procedure that takes input data and transforms it into desired output. Algorithms form the foundation of all AI systems, defining how machines process information, learn patterns, and make decisions.

Examples: Decision trees, k-means clustering, gradient descent, support vector machines.

Challenges: Algorithms can be biased based on training data, may not generalize well to new situations, and can be computationally expensive. Some algorithms are "black boxes" making it difficult to understand their decision-making process.
