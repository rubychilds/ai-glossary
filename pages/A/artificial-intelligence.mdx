# Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Computer systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence.

Longer Definition: AI encompasses machines and software that can perceive their environment, learn from experience, reason about problems, and make decisions. It includes narrow AI (specialized for specific tasks) and the theoretical concept of general AI (human-level intelligence across all domains).
Examples: Virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa), recommendation systems (Netflix, Amazon), autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis systems.

Challenges: Ethical concerns, job displacement, privacy issues, potential for misuse, difficulty in creating truly general intelligence, and ensuring AI systems remain aligned with human values.

History: The term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined in 1956 at Dartmouth College. Early work focused on symbolic reasoning and expert systems. The field has evolved through multiple "AI winters" and breakthroughs, with recent advances driven by deep learning and big data.
