# Artificial Intelligence (AI)

AI are Computer systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. Rather than following pre-programmed instructions for every scenario, AI systems can adapt their behavior based on data and experience, making decisions in situations they haven't explicitly encountered before.AI encompasses a broad spectrum of approaches and capabilities. Machine learning algorithms enable systems to improve their performance through exposure to data, while deep learning uses neural networks to recognize complex patterns. Natural language processing allows computers to understand and generate human language, and computer vision enables machines to interpret visual information. These technologies power applications ranging from recommendation systems and voice assistants to autonomous vehicles and medical diagnosis tools.

AI includes narrow AI (specialized for specific tasks) and the theoretical concept of general AI (human-level intelligence across all domains). For example: Virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa), recommendation systems (Netflix, Amazon), autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis systems.

Modern AI systems demonstrate remarkable capabilities in specific domains, often surpassing human performance in tasks like chess, image recognition, and protein folding prediction. However, current AI lacks the general intelligence that humans possess across diverse situations, leading to ongoing research into artificial general intelligence that could match human cognitive flexibility and understanding.

Challenges: Ethical concerns, job displacement, privacy issues, potential for misuse, difficulty in creating truly general intelligence, and ensuring AI systems remain aligned with human values.

## The History of AI

In 1950, Alan Turing proposed one of the earliest frameworks for evaluating AI. The Turing Test, as it became known, suggests that a machine could be considered intelligent if a human evaluator, engaging in natural language conversation, cannot reliably distinguish the machine's responses from those of a human. While this test has limitations and doesn't capture all aspects of intelligence, it established an important benchmark for AI development and sparked decades of debate about what constitutes true machine intelligence.

The term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined in 1956 at Dartmouth College. Early work focused on symbolic reasoning and expert systems. The field has evolved through multiple "AI winters" and breakthroughs, with recent advances driven by deep learning and big data.

## Evaluating AI Today

Testing whether something qualifies as AI today involves a sophisticated array of standardized benchmarks and evaluation methods that have evolved far beyond the original Turing Test. Modern AI evaluation relies on specialized benchmarks tailored to different capabilities and domains, providing quantitative measures of performance rather than subjective human judgement.

For language models, researchers use benchmarks like MT-Bench, which evaluates conversational ability and reasoning, and HumanEval, which tests coding proficiency. [SWE-Bench launched](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/08/1116192/how-to-build-a-better-ai-benchmark/) in November 2024 to evaluate an AI model's coding skill, using more than 2,000 real-world programming problems. These benchmarks measure specific competencies like mathematical reasoning, reading comprehension, and problem-solving across diverse scenarios.

Computer vision systems are tested using datasets like ImageNet for object recognition, or specialized benchmarks for medical imaging, autonomous driving, and facial recognition. [AI-Benchmark](https://ai-benchmark.com/tests.html) consists of 78 AI and Computer Vision tests performed by neural networks, measuring over 180 different aspects of AI performance, including speed, accuracy, and initialization time.

Performance evaluation has become increasingly sophisticated, with [MLPerf benchmarks developed](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/resources/mlperf-benchmarks/) by MLCommons providing unbiased evaluations of training and inference performance for hardware, software, and services. These standardized tests allow direct comparison between different AI systems under controlled conditions.

Recent developments include more complex evaluation frameworks. RE-Bench introduced in 2024 evaluates complex tasks for AI agents, where top AI systems score four times higher than human experts in short time-horizon settings [Technical Performance](https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report/technical-performance), though human performance often surpasses AI when given more time.

The field increasingly recognizes that no single test can capture all aspects of intelligence, leading to comprehensive benchmark suites that evaluate multiple dimensions of AI capability simultaneously.
