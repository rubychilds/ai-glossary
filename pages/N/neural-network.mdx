MCP (Model Context Protocol)
Short Definition: A standardized way for AI models to connect with external data sources and tools.
Longer Definition: MCP provides a universal interface that allows language models to securely access and interact with various external systems, databases, and APIs. It enables models to retrieve real-time information and perform actions beyond their training data.
Examples: Connecting models to databases, file systems, web APIs, calculators, or other external tools for enhanced functionality.
Challenges: Security concerns with external access, ensuring reliable connections, managing authentication and permissions, and maintaining performance with external dependencies.
