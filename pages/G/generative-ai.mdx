# Generative AI

AI systems that can create new content, such as text, images, audio, or code.

Generative AI models learn patterns from training data to produce novel content that resembles the training examples. Unlike discriminative models that classify or predict, generative models create new instances of data.

Examples: GPT models for text generation, DALL-E for image creation, Copilot for code generation, music composition AI.
Challenges: Ensuring output quality and relevance, avoiding copyright infringement, preventing generation of harmful content, computational requirements, and maintaining factual accuracy.
