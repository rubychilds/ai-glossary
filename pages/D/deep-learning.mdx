# Deep Learning
Short Definition: A subset of machine learning using neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns.
Longer Definition: Deep learning uses artificial neural networks with many hidden layers (typically 3 or more) to automatically learn hierarchical representations from data. Unlike traditional machine learning, it can automatically discover relevant features without manual feature engineering.

Examples: Image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, game playing (AlphaGo), drug discovery.
Challenges: Requires large amounts of data and computational power, models are often "black boxes," prone to overfitting, and can be sensitive to adversarial attacks.

History: Built on neural network research from the 1940s-80s. The term "deep learning" gained prominence in the 2000s with Geoffrey Hinton's work. GPU computing and big data enabled the deep learning revolution of the 2010s.
